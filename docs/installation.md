# Installation

For instructions on setting up the full captive portal stack, please see the
[Full Stack](full-stack.md) documentation.

## Database Setup

Regardless of which method is used, a database is needed to save data. If you're
using an SQLite database, no extra action is needed as the file will be created
at first run.

If you're going to use MySQL, you will need create a table for Packet Guardian
before starting it. The application will create the tables as needed. Make sure
to set the correct settings in the configuration file.

## Automatic Installation (recommended)

1. Get a copy of the distribution package from the Github releases page.
2. Untar it to /opt.
3. Run `scripts/install.sh`
4. Edit the configurations as needed. See the related documentation for each
   format.
5. Start Packet Guardian

```bash
# Run as root
cd /opt
wget https://github.com/packet-guardian/packet-guardian/releases/latest/pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
tar -xzf pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd packet-guardian
./scripts/install.sh
```

The install script will place the configuration files in `/etc/packet-guardian`,
the SQLite database at `/var/lib/packet-guardian/database.sqlite3`, and the log
files at `/var/log/packet-guardian`. Edit the files in `/etc/packet-guardian` to
suit your environment. The file config-pg.toml will be read by the webserver
component and config-dhcp.toml will be read by the DHCP server. config-dhcp.toml
is basically a stripped down version of the full config. You can use the same
configuration for both binaries, but you will need to edit the Upstart/Systemd
service files to do so.

## Manually

Before going to much further, it is highly recommended that you use the
automatic installation script. It will ensure everything is set up correctly and
in its proper place. Only use the manual method if you absolutely have to.

1. Get a copy of the distribution package from the Github releases page.
2. Extract the tarball to a directory. It will create a packet-guardian folder
   when extracted.
3. The configuration files are located in the config directory. There are sample
   files for the webserver component and the DHCP component. It's recommended to
   copy the sample files and edit as needed. The .toml files are the given to
   the binary at runtime. The dhcp-config.conf file is where the DHCP scopes and
   server settings are defined. See the relevant documentation for those file
   formats. You WILL NEED to edit the configuration and set the correct paths.
   The defaults paths assume the installation method is the automatic install
   script.
4. To start the system, run the following commands with the current directory
   being the packet-guardian folder extracted earlier: `bin/pg -c
   $path_to_config` and `bin/dhcp -c $path_to_config`. Both binaries take the
   .toml file as the -c option. The path to the DHCP scope configuration is
   defined in the toml file.
5. To setup AppArmor or run the binaries as services, please read the
   [Additional Installation](additional-installation.md) documentation.

## Configuration file location

The configuration file may be explicitly given to PG at runtime or it will look
for the file in a predefined set of directories. The order being:

- The `-c` flag when run from the command line
- The `PG_CONFIG` environment variable - This is how the service files give the
  configuration file
- `$PWD/config.toml`
- `$PWD/config/config.toml`
- `$HOME/.pg/config.toml`
- `/etc/packet-guardian/config.toml`

If a configuration file isn't found, PG will exit with an error.
