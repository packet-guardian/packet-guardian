# Upgrading

## Installed Via Automatic Script

If Packet Guardian was installed using the install script, upgrading is as
simple as one command. When Packet Guardian was installed, a command called
`pg-upgrade` was also installed that helps with upgrading.

```Bash
wget https://github.com/packet-guardian/packet-guardian/releases/latest/pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
pg-upgrade pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
```

You can skip the confirmation prompt by using the `-y` flag before the tar
filename.

## Manually Installed

To upgrade Packet Guardian manually, move the current installation to a
different folder, untar the new version, and apply any necassary edits to
configuration files if they weren't located outside of the main folder.

```bash
wget https://github.com/packet-guardian/packet-guardian/releases/latest/pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd /opt
mv packet-guardian packet-guardian.old
tar -xzf pg-dist-$VERSION.tar.gz
```
