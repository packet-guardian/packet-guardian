# Additional Installation

## Running as a Service

If you used the script `scripts/install.sh` this was done for you.

Run these commands as root.

### Upstart - Ubuntu < 15.04

```bash
useradd -M packetg
chown -R packetg:packetg /opt/packet-guardian
cp $APP_DIR/config/service/upstart/pg.conf /etc/init/pg.conf
cp $APP_DIR/config/service/upstart/dhcp.conf /etc/init/pg-dhcp.conf
chown root:root /etc/init/pg.conf
chown root:root /etc/init/pg-dhcp.conf
service pg start
service pg-dhcp start
```

### Systemd - Ubuntu >= 15.04, Fedora, CentOS, Arch

```bash
useradd -M packetg
chown -R packetg:packetg /opt/packet-guardian
cp $APP_DIR/config/service/systemd/pg.service /etc/systemd/system/pg.service
cp $APP_DIR/config/service/systemd/dhcp.service /etc/systemd/system/pg-dhcp.service
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/pg.service
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/pg-dhcp.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start pg
systemctl start pg-dhcp
systemctl enable pg.service
systemctl enable pg-dhcp.service
```

If Packet Guardian is not starting, you may need to run `setcap
'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/packet-guardian/bin/pg` and `setcap
'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /opt/packet-guardian/bin/dhcp`. This will set kernal
permissions to allow the binaries to bind to restricted ports.

## AppArmor

If you used the script `scripts/install.sh` this was done for you.

It's recommended to use AppArmor with Packet Guardian. AppArmor is a permissions
enforcement system on Ubuntu. It's equivalent to SELinux in CentOS and Red Hat.
A base AppArmor profile has been included in the `config` directory. You may
need to edit it depending on how you setup Packet Guardian. There are separate
profiles for both the main pg and dhcp binaries. The file `apparmor.conf`
assumes PG is installed in `/opt/packet-guardian`. The file `apparmor-ext.conf`
assumes you've run the script `$REPO_DIR/install.sh` which spreads out the
configuration and puts files into their appropriate places in the file system.
Use which ever is appropriate for your situation.

Here's how to get start (run as root):

```bash
cd $PG_ROOT # By default /opt/packet-guardian
# Make sure to change the last part to match the real location of the binary
cp config/apparmor.conf /etc/apparmor.d/opt.packet-guardian.bin.pg
chown root:root /etc/apparmor.d/opt.packet-guardian.bin.pg
aa-complain /opt/packet-guardian/bin/pg
```

Using `aa-complain` is the safest to begin with. This will allow Packet Guardian
to do anything it wants (within user and group permissions), but will warn in
the syslog if it steps outside of its AppArmor profile. Adjust the profile as
needed. Use the command `aa-enforce` to completely enable the profile.
