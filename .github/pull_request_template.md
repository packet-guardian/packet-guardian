## Proposed changes

Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainer
why this pull request should be accepted. If it fixes a bug or resolves a
feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

## Branching and commit layout

* Make sure you are requesting to **pull a topic/feature/bugfix branch** (right
  side). Don't request your master!
* Make sure you are making a pull request against the **develop branch** (left
  side). Also you should start *your branch* off *our develop*.
* Squash commits into one or few logical changesets. The idea is to keep the
  development history without polluting the repo with temporary or reversed
  changes. [How to squash
  commits](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/02/19/squashing-github-pull-requests-into-a-single-commit)
