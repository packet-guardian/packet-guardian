## The site domain name is used to determine when to tell the client to cache.
## Packet Guardian relies on DNS redirection to work and may be configured to accept
## requests from any domain name. If the domain name matches this setting, the client
## is instructed to cache. Otherwise it's instructed to never cache. This should avoid
## situation where a registered client shows a ghost page when going to the same domain
## as was redirected to this application. It must include the port if not normal http/https
## Example: wifi.example.com  OR  wifi.example.com:5000

## This is the time between wake ups for the job scheduler. When the appliacation first

## value is used, it will default to 1h.
